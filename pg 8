(in file Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving field that focuses on building intelligent systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

AI has various subfields such as machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. It has significant applications in domains like healthcare, finance, education, and autonomous systems.

Despite its many advantages, AI raises concerns about ethics, privacy, and employment. It is important to ensure responsible development of AI by incorporating transparency, fairness, and human-centered design principles.)
